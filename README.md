**# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classifier

This project is a machine learning-based spam detection system built in Python.
It uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify email/SMS messages as either **spam** or **not spam**.

---

##  Features

-  Trains on a real-world SMS spam dataset
-  Uses `Naive Bayes` for classification
-  Text preprocessing with `CountVectorizer`
-  99%+ accuracy on test data
-  Object-Oriented design for modularity and readability

---

##  How It Works

1. **Loads a dataset** of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam)
2. **Cleans and vectorizes** text using scikit-learn's `CountVectorizer`
3. **Splits data** into training and testing sets
4. **Trains a Naive Bayes classifier**
5. **Evaluates accuracy and F1-score**
6. **Predicts new message classifications**


##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- NumPy
